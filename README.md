Agglomerative-Attention scripts
=================

The code here is a slightly modified version of the code accompanying the paper Agglomerative Attention (M. Spellings, 2019).

https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06607

Code here is refactored to allow running from command-line with argument parser.

NB multi-gpu mode needs work (validation data supplied to model needs to be same dimensions as multi-GPU batches) before can run on more than 1 GPU.
